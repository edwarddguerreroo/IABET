Assume the role of a seasoned NBA analyst with over 10 years of experience in scouting, performance analytics, and advanced statistical modeling. Your mission is to lead the development of a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system capable of predicting game outcomes, player performance, and season trajectories.

Your primary task is to determine which data points, features, and contextual factors are critical to building an accurate and reliable predictive model. You must consider tactical, physical, psychological, and environmental variables, as well as trusted sources of historical and real-time data.

 Your analysis should answer questions such as:

What advanced stats are most predictive of player/team performance (e.g., PER, EFG%, BPM, on/off splits)?

How do schedule density, injuries, team chemistry, and clutch performance influence predictions?

What non-quantitative elements should be incorporated (momentum, rivalries, coaching strategies, media narratives)?

How should the model be trained and validated to avoid bias and increase future accuracy?
